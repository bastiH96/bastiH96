# Hi there 👋 I'm Sebastian. 😁

<!-- [![trophy](https://github-profile-trophy.vercel.app/?username=bastiH96)](https://github.com/ryo-ma/github-profile-trophy) -->

- 📚 I’m currently working on [WpfMauiUiComparing](https://github.com/bastiH96/WpfMauiUiComparing.git) and [WpfMauiPerformanceComparing](https://github.com/bastiH96/WpfMauiPerformanceComparing.git). These are both projects for my bachelor thesis in which I compare Maui and WPF based on how good they are by developing desktop applications for Windows.

- 🕹 For private use and for some of my work colleagues, I am also working on [ShiftcomparingAppMaui](https://github.com/bastiH96/ShiftcomparingAppMAUI.git) . This is an app in which the user can create any number of shift plans with different shiftpatterns and compare them with each other. It should be possible to print the shift plans in the app and as CSV file so that family members or friends can easily have a shift plan from you to know when you are at home and when you have to work.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning and improving my skills in C# especially .NET, MAUI and WPF.
