# Hi there 👋 I'm Sebastian. 😁

<!-- [![trophy](https://github-profile-trophy.vercel.app/?username=bastiH96)](https://github.com/ryo-ma/github-profile-trophy) -->

- 🕹 I'm currently working on [DiscordBotPython](https://github.com/bastiH96/discordBotPython.git). It's a discord bot with the main purpose to create any number of shift plans with different shiftpatterns and compare them with each other. The bot saves people and their shiftsystem to a sqlite database so the user is able to build any constalation they want and recieve it as XLSX-file so family members or friends can easily have their shift plan to know when they have to work or are at home.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning and improving my skills in Python especially discord.py, openpyxl, polars, Qt and Selenium.
